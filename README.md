# BioIdealT5

## Overview
BioIdealT5 is a transformer-based model designed for summarizing biomedical questions. It leverages the T5 architecture, fine-tuned specifically for the biomedical domain to generate concise and accurate summaries of complex biomedical queries.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Transformers library by Hugging Face
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- JSON

## Installation
To use BioIdealT5, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this using pip:
```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to fine-tune the T5 model using a custom dataset. Key steps include:

1. **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess the data from a JSON file. Combine question texts and context snippets to create training examples.
2. **Tokenization**: Use the Hugging Face tokenizer to convert text inputs into token IDs suitable for the T5 model.
3. **Feature Conversion**: Create input and target encodings from the preprocessed text.
4. **Model Fine-tuning**: Set up training arguments and use the Trainer API from Hugging Face to fine-tune the model for additional epochs.
5. **Saving the Model**: Save the fine-tuned model for later use.

### Generating Summaries
Once the model is fine-tuned, it can be used to generate summaries for new biomedical questions. The notebook demonstrates how to:

1. **Load the Fine-tuned Model**: Load the previously saved model.
2. **Set Up the Summarization Pipeline**: Create a summarization pipeline using the fine-tuned model.
3. **Generate Summaries**: Process each question and generate a summary using the pipeline.
4. **Save Summaries**: Save the generated summaries to text files for further use or analysis.

## Example
Here is a high-level example of how to use BioIdealT5 for generating summaries:

1. **Load the JSON Data**:
    ```python
    with open('path_to_json_file.json', 'r') as json_file:
        json_data = json.load(json_file)
    ```

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
    ```python
    questions_list = preprocess_data(json_data)
    df = pd.DataFrame(questions_list)
    ```

3. **Fine-tune the Model**:
    ```python
    trainer.train()
    trainer.save_model('path_to_save_model')
    ```

4. **Generate Summaries**:
    ```python
    for question in df['Combined_Text']:
        summary = pipeline(question)
        save_summary(summary, 'output_folder')
    ```
